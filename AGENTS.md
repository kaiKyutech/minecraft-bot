# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `test.js` hosts the Mineflayer bot setup, event handlers, and is the executable entry point; add new behaviors or helpers alongside this file or split them into future `src/` modules when logic grows.
- `package.json` defines the CommonJS runtime, dependency on `mineflayer`, and npm scripts; keep shared configuration (lint, format, test) here.
- `node_modules/` is generated by `npm install`; never commit it. Store credentials or per-user settings in ignored environment files instead of source.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm install` installs Mineflayer and any added tooling; re-run after dependency changes.
- `node test.js` starts the bot against the configured host/port; run it in a terminal attached to your Minecraft server.
- `npm test` currently fails by design—replace the placeholder script with real test runners before relying on CI.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Use modern JavaScript with 2-space indentation, double-quoted strings (matching the existing file), and trailing semicolons for clarity.
- Group related bot events together and extract reusable helpers into modules (`require("./path")`) as behavior grows.
- Document non-obvious protocol interactions with concise comments so future agents understand Mineflayer expectations.

## Testing Guidelines
- Add automated checks under a `__tests__/` or `test/` directory and wire them through `npm test`; Jest works well with CommonJS and Mineflayer mocks.
- Prefer scenario-based tests that simulate chat commands or error conditions; include at least one regression test when fixing bugs.
- Capture manual test notes (server version, seed, plugins) in PR descriptions so others can reproduce behavior locally.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Write imperative, present-tense commit subjects under 72 characters (e.g., `Add ping command response`).
- Reference related issues and explain test coverage in the PR body; include screenshots or console logs when bot output changes.
- Ensure your branch merges cleanly, all npm scripts pass, and reviewers can reproduce your setup using the documented commands.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Keep production server credentials out of source control; load sensitive values (tokens, hosts) via environment variables or `.env.local`.
- When testing on shared servers, throttle new chat commands to avoid rate limits and monitor logs for unexpected disconnects.
